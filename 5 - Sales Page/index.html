For example, patients with depression are 64% more            likely to develop coronary artery disease. </p>          <p class="MsoNormal">Likewise, depression is commonly found in            patients with cancer, HIV, Parkinsonâ€™s, and eating disorders. The            relationship between depression and other serious illnesses shows            just how serious depression can be and how it creeps into all many            phases of life. </p>          <p class="MsoNormal">To make matters worse, depression can infiltrate            one's life so much that it eventually leads to suicide. In fact,            there are over 30,000 suicides in the United States every year, and            depression is the culprit for two-thirds of these cases. </p>          <p class="MsoNormal">To put that in perspective, for every two            homicides that happen in the United States, there are three            suicides.</p>          <div class="questionTitle middleFont">            <h1>Depression Makes You Feel Hopeless<br>            </h1>            <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; </p>            <p style="text-align: left;">One feeling that is often associated              with depression and suicide is hopelessness, but many others              experience hopelessness too. </p>            <p style="text-align: left;">Hopelessness turns into a vicious cycle              that makes one feel unable to control themselves, their behaviors,              and the world around them. </p>            <p style="text-align: left;">Although it's true that you cannot              control the world around you, You can control yourself. </p>            <p style="text-align: left;">In fact, it is completely possible to              gain control of your life and create the best life possible              through your actions.
